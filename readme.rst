DocTree
=======

This is an elaboration on my Apropos application,
with a vertical rather than a horizontal organisation of notes,
based on a simple project management application I found on an IBM site.

I pretty much abandoned it in favour of Doctree, which I started after wondering
"If I'm going to have a tree in the left pane, why not one with more levels
than just one?"

I'm considering integrating this with DocTree by sharing the code base and offering
a simple and an extended version of the same application.

Perhaps I can even combine this with Apropos, keeping this simplified version around
may make researching stuff like that easier.

In the mean time, I used this app to try out implementing classic gettext
multilanguage support

Requirements
------------

- Python
- PyQT4 for the current GUI version
- wxPython for the older GUI version
